This example demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles where the failure of `npm install` (or similar commands) is not properly handled.  The `RUN` instruction does not stop the build process if the command fails. This can lead to a seemingly successful build producing a non-functional image.

The solution demonstrates how to check the exit code of `npm install` and fail the build if necessary.
